== 31 October 2024

This BlueXP disaster recovery release includes the following updates: 

* *Reporting*: With this release, you can now generate and download reports to help you analyze your landscape. Predesigned reports summarize failovers and failbacks, show replication details on all sites, and show job details for the past year. 
+
For details, see link:../use/reports.html[Create disaster recovery reports].
//Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/reports.html[Create disaster recovery reports].

* *30-day free trials*: With this release, you can now sign up for a 30-day free trial of BlueXP disaster recovery. Previously, free trials were for 90 days.
+
For details, see link:../get-started/dr-licensing.html[Set up licensing].
//Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/get-started/dr-licensing.html[Set up licensing].

* *Folder mapping*: When you create a replication plan and map compute resources, you can now map folders so that VMs are recovered in a folder you specify for datacenter, cluster, and host.
+
For details, see link:../use/drplan-create.html[Create a replication plan].
//For details, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/drplan-create.html[Create a replication plan].

* *VM details available for failover, failback, and test failover*: When a failure occurs and you are starting a failover, performing a failback, or testing the failover, you can now see details of the VMs and identify which VMs did not restart. 
+
Refer to link:../use/failover.html[Fail over applications to a remote site].
//Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/failover.html[Fail over applications to a remote site].

* *VM boot delay with ordered boot sequence*: When you create a replication plan, you can now set a boot delay for each VM in the plan. This enables you to set a sequence for the VMs to start to ensure that all your priority one VMs are running before subsequent priority VMs are started. 
+
For details, see link:../use/drplan-create.html[Create a replication plan].
//For details, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/drplan-create.html[Create a replication plan].

* *VM operating system*: When you create a replication plan, you can now specify the operating system for each VM in the plan. This is helpful in deciding how to group VMs together in a resource group.
+
For details, see link:../use/drplan-create.html[Create a replication plan].
//For details, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/drplan-create.html[Create a replication plan].


* *VM name aliasing*: When you create a replication plan, you can now add a prefix and suffix to the VM names. This enables you to use a more descriptive name for the VMs in the plan.
+
For details, see link:../use/drplan-create.html[Create a replication plan].
//For details, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/drplan-create.html[Create a replication plan].

* *On-demand snapshot cleanup*: With this release, when you delete a replication plan, you can clean up any snapshots that are no longer needed beyond your specified retention count. Snapshots might accumulate over time when you lower your snapshot retention count, and you can now remove them to free up space.
+
For details, see link:../use/drplan-create.html[Delete a replication plan].
//For details, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/drplan-create.html[Delete a replication plan].

* *Reconcile snapshots*: With this release, you can now reconcile snapshots that are out of sync between the source and target. This might occur if snapshots are deleted on a target outside of BlueXP disaster recovery. The service automatically deletes the snapshot on the source automatically every 24 hours. However, you can perform this on demand. This feature enables you to ensure that the snapshots are consistent across all sites.
+
For details, see link:../use/manage.html[Manage replication plans].
//For details, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/manage.html[Manage replication plans].

== 20 September 2024

This BlueXP disaster recovery release includes the following update. 

* *Support for on-premises to on-premises VMware VMFS datastores*: This release includes support for VMs mounted on VMware vSphere virtual machine file system (VMFS) datastores for iSCSI and FC protected to on-premises storage. Previously, the service provided a _technology preview_ supporting VMFS datastores for iSCSI and FC.  
+
Here are some additional considerations regarding both iSCSI and FC protocols: 
+
** FC support is for client front-end protocols, not for replication. 
** BlueXP disaster recovery supports only a single LUN per ONTAP volume. The volume should not have multiple LUNs. 
** For any replication plan, the destination ONTAP volume should use the same protocols as the source ONTAP volume hosting the protected VMs. For example, if the source uses an FC protocol, the destination should also use FC.

== 17 July 2024 
This BlueXP disaster recovery release includes the following updates: 

* *Failover test schedules*: This release includes updates to the failover test schedule structure, which was needed to support daily and weekly schedules. This update requires that you disable and re-enable all existing replication plans so that you will be able to use the new daily and weekly failover test schedules. This is a one-time requirement.  
+
Here's how: 
+
. From the top menu, select *Replication plans*. 
. Select a plan and select the Actions icon to show the drop-down menu. 
. Select *Disable*. 
. After a few minutes, select *Enable*.

* *Replication plan updates*: This release includes updates to replication plan data, which resolves a "snapshot not found" issue. This requires that you change the retention count in all replication plans to 1 and initiate an on-demand snapshot. This process creates a new backup and removes all older backups. 
+
Here's how: 
+
. From the top menu, select *Replication plans*. 
. Select the replication plan, click the *Failover mapping* tab, and click the *Edit* pencil icon. 
. Click the *Datastores* arrow to expand it. 
//+
//image:use/dr-plan-failover-edit.png[Edit failover mappings page]
. Note the value of the retention count in the replication plan. You will need to reinstate this original value when you're finished with these steps. 
. Reduce the count to 1.
. Initiate an on-demand snapshot. To do so, on the Replication plan page, select the plan, click the Actions icon, and select *Take snapshot now*. 
. After the snapshot job completes successfully, increase the count in the replication plan back to its original value that you noted in the first step. 
. Repeat these steps for all existing replication plans.

This release includes the following updates: 

* *Resource groups update for boot order*: When you create a disaster recovery or replication plan, you can add virtual machines into functional resource groups. Resource groups enable you to put a set of dependent virtual machines into logical groups that meet your requirements. For example, groups could contain boot order that can be executed upon recovery. With this release, each resource group can include one or more virtual machines. The virtual machines will power on based on the sequence in which you include them in the plan. Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/drplan-create.html#select-applications-to-replicate-and-assign-resource-groups[Select applications to replicate and assign resource groups].
 


* *Replication verification*: After you create the disaster recovery or replication plan, identify the recurrence in the wizard, and initiate a replication to a disaster recovery site, every 30 minutes BlueXP disaster recovery verifies that the replication is actually occurring according to the plan. You can monitor the progress in the Job Monitor page. Refer to  https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/replicate.html[Replicate applications to another site].

* *Replication plan shows recovery point objective (RPO) transfer schedules*: When you create a disaster recovery or replication plan, you select the VMs. In this release, you can now view the SnapMirror associated with each of the volumes that are associated with the datastore or VM. You can also see the RPO transfer schedules that are associated with the SnapMirror schedule. RPO helps you determine whether your backup schedule is enough to recover after a disaster. Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/drplan-create.html[Create a replication plan].

* *Job Monitor update*: The Job Monitor page now includes a Refresh option so that you can get an up-to-date status of operations. Refer to  https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-disaster-recovery/use/monitor-jobs.html[Monitor disaster recovery jobs].
