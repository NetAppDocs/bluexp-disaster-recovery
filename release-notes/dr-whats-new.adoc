//tag::whats-new[]
== 18 May 2023 

With the new BlueXP disaster recovery beta service for VMware, you can protect machine-critical business VMware applications by using VMware Cloud (VMC) as a disaster recovery site. In case of a disaster, use BlueXP disaster recovery to fail over applications to the cloud with near-zero recovery time. 

BlueXP disaster recovery is a cloud-based disaster recovery service that automates disaster recovery workflows. Initially, with the BlueXP disaster recovery beta you can protect your on-premises VMware workloads on NetApp storage to the cloud (VMware Cloud on AWS with Amazon FSx for ONTAP).


The beta enables you to achieve disaster recovery with VMware workloads on NFS.
