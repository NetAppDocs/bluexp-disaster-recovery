Disaster recovery to the cloud is a resilient and cost-effective way of protecting workloads against site outages and data corruption events. With BlueXP disaster recovery for VMware preview, you can replicate your on-premises VMware workloads running ONTAP storage to a VMware software-defined data center in a public cloud as a disaster recovery site using NetApp cloud storage.

BlueXP disaster recovery Beta is a cloud-based disaster recovery service that automates disaster recovery workflows. Initially, with the BlueXP disaster recovery preview you can protect your on-premises, NFS-based VMware workloads running NetApp storage to VMware Cloud (VMC) on AWS with Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP.

BlueXP disaster recovery preview uses ONTAP SnapMirror technology as the replication transport to the cloud. This enables industry-best storage efficiency (compression and deduplication) on primary and secondary sites. 

The preview supports disaster recovery for on-premises workloads to the cloud.

== Benefits of using BlueXP disaster recovery for VMware preview

BlueXP disaster recovery preview offers the following benefits:

* Simplified user experience for vCenter discovery and recovery of applications with multiple point-in-time recovery operations 
* Lower total cost of ownership with reduced cost of operations and ability to create and adjust disaster recovery plans with minimal resources
* Continuous disaster recovery readiness with virtual failover testing that does not disrupt operations
* Faster time to value with dynamic changes in your IT environment and ability to address it in your disaster recovery plans

== What you can do with BlueXP disaster recovery for VMware preview 
The BlueXP disaster recovery preview provides you with full use of several NetApp technologies to accomplish the following goals: 

* Replicate VMware apps on your production site to a disaster recovery remote site in the cloud using SnapMirror replication.
* In case of disaster, fail over your primary site on demand to a NetApp cloud volume in VMware Cloud on AWS.
* After the disaster has been resolved, fail back on demand from the disaster recovery site to the primary site.

With NetApp SnapMirror technology, on-premises VMware workloads (for NFS) can be replicated to FSx for NetApp ONTAP running in AWS.

NOTE: Configuration of vSphere server is done outside of BlueXP disaster recovery in vSphere Server. 


== Cost

NetApp doesn’t charge you for using the preview version of BlueXP disaster recovery.

The BlueXP disaster recovery service, upon general availability, is expected to offer Pay-As-You-Go pricing or an annual subscription-based plan. 

== How BlueXP disaster recovery preview works

BlueXP disaster recovery preview can recover workloads replicated from on-premises to Amazon FSx for ONTAP. This service automates the recovery from the SnapMirror level, through virtual machine registration to Virtual Machine Cloud (VMC), and to network mappings directly on the VMware network virtualization and security platform, NSX-T. This feature is included with all Virtual Machine Cloud environments.

BlueXP disaster recovery preview uses ONTAP SnapMirror technology, which provides highly efficient replication and preserves the ONTAP incremental-forever Snapshot efficiencies. SnapMirror replication ensures that application-consistent Snapshot copies are always in sync and the data is usable immediately after a failover.

When there is a disaster, this service helps you recover virtual machines in the VMC by breaking the SnapMirror relationships and making the destination site active. 

* The service also lets you fail back virtual machines to the original source location.  
* You can test the disaster recovery failover process without disrupting the original virtual machines. The test recovers virtual machines to an isolated network by creating a FlexClone of the volume.
* For the failover or test failover process, you can choose the latest (default) or selected Snapshot from which to recover your virtual machine.
