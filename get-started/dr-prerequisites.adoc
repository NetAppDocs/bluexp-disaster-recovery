Get started by verifying the readiness of your operational environment, login, network access, and web browser.

To use BlueXP disaster recovery, you should ensure that your environment meets the following requirements: 

* On-premise VMware working environment with NetApp storage
* On AWS: 
** An Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system. Refer to Amazon FSx for ONTAP documentation on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/getting-started-step1.html[how to get started^]. 

** A VMware account with a software-defined data center (SDDC) on AWS, also referred to as Virtual Machines Cloud. In the VMware Cloud Console, use the service roles of Administrator and NSX Cloud Administrator, both roles on VMWare Cloud on AWS. Also use the Organization owner for the Organization role. Refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/vmware-cloud-ontap.html[Virtual Machines Cloud documentation^]. 

** Link the SDDC with Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP. Refer to https://vmc.techzone.vmware.com/fsx-guide#overview[VMware Cloud on AWS integration with Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP^].


* In BlueXP: 

**	The BlueXP Connector needs to be set up in NetApp BlueXP. Use the BlueXP AWS Connector, which has access to both the on-premises vCenter and the cloud. The BlueXP Connector requires credentials for both the source and target vCenter servers. Refer to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-quick-start-standard-mode.html[BlueXP Quick start^] and https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/reference-networking-saas-console.html[BlueXP networking information^]. 

** Use the BlueXP on-premises Connector or the BlueXP AWS Connector, which has access to the source on-premises vCenter and the destination on-premises vCenter.

** Amazon FSx for ONTAP and AWS credentials added to the BlueXP working environment

** The on-premises and cloud Connector should have connectivity to both the on-premises and VMware Cloud (VMC) VCenter with ESXis. This enables the failover, failback and migration features to work properly with the needed networking and script features.
