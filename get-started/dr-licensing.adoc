[.lead]
With BlueXP disaster recovery, you can use different licensing plans including a free trial, a pay-as-you-go subscription, or bring your own license. 

You can use any of the following license types:

* Sign up for a 90-day free trial.
* Purchase a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) subscription for 1, 2 or 3 years with Amazon Web Services Marketplace.
* Bring your own license (BYOL), which is a NetApp License File (NLF) that you obtain from the NetApp Support Site (NSS). 

NOTE: BlueXP disaster recovery charges are based on provisioned capacity of datastores on the source site when there is at least one VM that has a replication plan. Capacity for a failed over datastore is not included in the capacity allowance. 

Licenses for all BlueXP services are managed by the BlueXP digital wallet service. After you set up your BYOL, you can see an active subscription for the service in the BlueXP digital wallet.



== Try it out using a 90-day free trial
You can try BlueXP disaster recovery out by using a 90-day free trial.

NOTE: A capacity limit is not enforced during the trial.  

You can subscribe at any time and you will not be charged until the 90-day trial ends. To continue after the 90-day trial, you'll need to purchase a BYOL license from NetApp. 

After the trial ends, you can still do the following in the service:

* Delete a workload.
* Delete data from a workload.
* Run all scheduled operations.

== Use an AWS Marketplace pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) license

If you choose to use an AWS Marketplace PAYGO license, you'll need to set it up in AWS first and then in BlueXP. 

=== Configure a PAYGO license in AWS
Here is a high level summary of the steps to configure a PAYGO license in AWS. 

For additional details, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-adding-aws-accounts.html[Manage AWS credentials and marketplace subscriptions for BlueXP^]. 

.Before you begin

You must have already worked with NetApp Sales team and obtained the offer link and you must have permissions to accept the offer as described in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/buyerguide/buyer-iam-users-groups-policies.html[Controlling access to AWS Marketplace subscriptions].

.Steps
. Accept the AWS Marketplace Private offer for NetApp BlueXP in the AWS console. 
+ 
Refer to the following information: 
+
* https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/awsmarketplace/access-your-private-offers-aws-marketplace-console/[Access your private offers through the AWS Marketplace console].
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/buyerguide/private-offers-page.html#private-offers-page-permissions[Required permissions to view the Private offers page].

. Review the Private offer details and validate that is matches your agreement. Because the billing starts once you click *Subscribe*, if any information is incorrect, *do not* accept the Private offer and instead contact your NetApp Sale Representative. 

. After you confirm that the offer information is correct, select *Subscribe*. 
+
If the offer uses a contract listing, also enter the number of units per service. Then, you can accept the Private offer by selecting *Create contract*. 

. In the popup, select *Set up your account*, which redirects you to the NetApp BlueXP console to complete the configuration of your BlueXP Marketplace subscription. 
+
If the offer uses a contract listing, select *View purchase options* and then *Set up your account*. 

=== Configure your AWS Marketplace subscription in BlueXP (Part 1)
After you've accepted the Private offer in the AWS console, you'll be directed to the BlueXP console. 

.Steps

. In the BlueXP console, do the following: 
.. Enter a display name for the SaaS Marketplace subscription. 
.. Select the NetApp BlueXP accounts that should have access to this Marketplace subscription. 
.. Choose *Replace existing subscription* to replace an existing SaaS Marketplace subscription in one NetApp BlueXP account with this newly created subscription. BlueXP will replace the existing subscription for all cloud credentials in the account with this new subscription. 
+
NOTE: The replace option is limited to a single NetApp BlueXP account. If you have multiple BlueXP accounts that you want to associate with the same SaaS Marketplace subscription, you'll need to configure them separately. 
+
NOTE: If a set of cloud credentials was never associated with a SaaS Marketplace subscription, you should configure it by following the next part of this procedure. 

. Select *Save* and *Done*. 

=== Associate the new SaaS Marketplace subscription with AWS credentials (Part 2)

. Access the https://console.bluexp.netapp.com[NetApp BlueXP console]. 
. Validate the subscription details: 
.. From the left pane, select *Governance* > *Digital wallet*. 
.. Select the *Subscriptions* tab. 
+
image:paygo-digitalwallet-subscriptions.png[BlueXP digital wallet Subscriptions page]

.. Look for the SaaS Marketplace subscription you added during Part 1 and validate that this is the correct plan you want to use. 

. Look for the row with your AWS subscription, expand the row to see the details, and confirm that your Private offer was successfully associated with your BlueXP account. 
+
Due to limitations in AWS Marketplace, some details of the offer are not available outside of the AWS console. If one of the fields displays "N/A", it means that the information could not be retrieved from the AWS console and is not a mistake. You can still check the information in the AWS console. 
. Select the *Settings* gear at the top right side of the BlueXP console and select *Credentials*. 
+
image:paygo-digitalwallet-settings.png[BlueXP digital wallet Settings menu]

. Locate the set of credentials that you want to associate with your new SaaS Marketplace subscription. 
+
TIP: You can validate that these are correct by clicking *View*  above Working Environments. 

. Select the *Actions ...* option and select *Associate subscription*. 

. Select your Private offer in the Marketplace Subscription drop-down menu and select *Associate*. 

+
NOTE: The Marketplace charges relating to these AWS credentials will now be billed via the SaaS Marketplace subscription you just associated. If you use annual contracts, infrastructure costs associated with these AWS credentials will count as usage against your annual contract. 

. Repeat these steps for any other AWS credentials in your BlueXP account that you want to associate with this SaaS Marketplace subscription: 
.. For AWS credentials in other BlueXP accounts, use the *Account* option at the top of the BlueXP console to switch accounts and repeat the steps. 
.. For AWS credentials related to other BlueXP Connectors, use the *Connector* option at the top of the BlueXP console to switch connectors and repeat the steps. 

=== Associate the new SaaS Marketplace subscription with AWS credentials (Part 2) if you have an annual contract

If you use an annual contract, the information in BlueXP appears somewhat differently. 

. Access the https://console.bluexp.netapp.com[NetApp BlueXP console]. 
. Validate the subscription details: 
.. From the left pane, select *Governance* > *Digital wallet*. 
.. Select the *Subscriptions* tab. 
+
image:paygo-digitalwallet-subscriptions-annualcontract.png[BlueXP digital wallet Subscriptions page showing an annual contract]

.. Look for the SaaS Marketplace subscription you added during Part 1 and validate that this is the correct plan you want to use. 

. Look for the row with your AWS yearly contract subscription, expand the row to see the details, and confirm that your Private offer was successfully associated with your BlueXP account. 

+
image:paygo-digitalwallet-subscriptions-annualcontract-associate.png[BlueXP digital wallet Subscriptions page for an annual contract]

. Select the *Actions ...* option on that row and select *Associate Subscription*. 

+

. Select the accounts you want to associate with the subscription and select *Apply*. 

+
NOTE: The Marketplace charges relating to these AWS credentials will now be billed via the SaaS Marketplace subscription you just associated. If you use annual contracts, infrastructure costs associated with these AWS credentials will count as usage against your annual contract. 

. Repeat these steps for any other AWS credentials in your BlueXP account that you want to associate with this SaaS Marketplace subscription: 
.. For AWS credentials in other BlueXP accounts, use the *Account* option at the top of the BlueXP console to switch accounts and repeat the steps. 
.. For AWS credentials related to other BlueXP Connectors, use the *Connector* option at the top of the BlueXP console to switch connectors and repeat the steps.

. In the list of columns that appears, check the columns that you want to display in the table. 

. Select *Apply*. 


== Use a bring-your-own-license (BYOL)
