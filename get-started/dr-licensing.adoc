[.lead]
With BlueXP disaster recovery, you can use different licensing plans including a free trial, a pay-as-you-go subscription, or bring your own license. 

You can use any of the following license types:

* Sign up for a 90-day free trial.
* Purchase a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) subscription for 1, 2 or 3 years with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace.
* Bring your own license (BYOL), which is a NetApp License File (NLF) that you obtain from your NetApp Sales Rep or from the NetApp Support Site (NSS). You can upload the NLF directly in BlueXP digital wallet or use the license serial number to get the BYOL activated in BlueXP digital wallet.

NOTE: BlueXP disaster recovery charges are based on provisioned capacity of datastores on the source site when there is at least one VM that has a replication plan. Capacity for a failed over datastore is not included in the capacity allowance. For a BYOL, if the data exceeds the allowed capacity, operations in the service are limited until you obtain an additional capacity license, upgrade the license in BlueXP digital wallet, or purchase a subscription in AWS. If you choose an AWS subscription, any capacity used above the contract limits is charged based on the AWS Marketplace plans. 

After you set up your BYOL or purchase a subscription in AWS, you can see the license in the BlueXP digital wallet *Data service Licenses* tab or the active subscription in the BlueXP digital wallet *Subscriptions* tab.

After the free trial ends or the license or AWS subscription expires, you can still do the following in the service:

* View any resource, such as a workload or replication plan.
* Delete any resource, such as a workload or replication plan.
* Run all scheduled operations that were created during the trial period, license, or subscription. 

== Try it out using a 90-day free trial
You can try BlueXP disaster recovery out by using a 90-day free trial.

NOTE: No capacity limits are enforced during the trial.  

You can get a license or subscribe at any time and you will not be charged until the 90-day trial ends. To continue after the 90-day trial, you'll need to purchase a BYOL license or PAYGO AWS subscription. 

During the trial, you have full functionality.

== Use an AWS pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) subscription

If you choose to use an AWS Marketplace PAYGO subscription, you'll need to set it up in AWS first and then in BlueXP. 

To set up a PAYGO subscription in AWS, complete the following procedures: 

* <<Part 1 Configure your PAYGO subscription in AWS>>
* <<Part 2 Configure your PAYGO subscription in BlueXP>>
* <<Part 3a Associate the new SaaS Marketplace subscription with AWS credentials>> or 
+
<<Part 3b Associate the new SaaS Marketplace subscription with AWS credentials for annual contracts>>.

==== Part 1 Configure your PAYGO subscription in AWS
Here is a high level summary of the steps to configure a PAYGO subscription in AWS. 

For additional details, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-adding-aws-accounts.html[Manage AWS credentials and marketplace subscriptions for BlueXP^]. 

.Before you begin

You must have already worked with NetApp Sales team and obtained the offer link and you must have permissions to accept the offer as described in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/buyerguide/buyer-iam-users-groups-policies.html[Controlling access to AWS Marketplace subscriptions^].

.Steps
. Accept the AWS Marketplace Private offer for NetApp BlueXP in the AWS console. 
+ 
Refer to the following information: 
+
* https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/awsmarketplace/access-your-private-offers-aws-marketplace-console/[Access your private offers through the AWS Marketplace console^].
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/buyerguide/private-offers-page.html#private-offers-page-permissions[Required permissions to view the Private offers page^].

. Review the Private offer details and validate that is matches your agreement. 
+
CAUTION: Because the billing starts once you click *Subscribe*, if any information is incorrect, *do not* accept the Private offer and instead contact your NetApp Sale Representative. 

. After you confirm that the offer information is correct, select *Subscribe*. 
+
If the offer uses a contract listing, also enter the number of units per service. Then, you can accept the Private offer by selecting *Create contract*. 

. In the popup, select *Set up your account*, which redirects you to the NetApp BlueXP console to complete the configuration of your BlueXP Marketplace subscription. 
+
If the offer uses a contract listing, select *View purchase options* and then *Set up your account*. 

==== Part 2 Configure your PAYGO subscription in BlueXP

After you've accepted the Private offer in the AWS console, you'll be directed to the BlueXP console. 

.Steps

. In the BlueXP console, do the following: 
.. Enter a display name for the SaaS Marketplace subscription. 
.. Select the NetApp BlueXP accounts that should have access to this Marketplace subscription. 
.. Choose *Replace existing subscription* to replace an existing SaaS Marketplace subscription in one NetApp BlueXP account with this newly created subscription. BlueXP will replace the existing subscription for all cloud credentials in the account with this new subscription. 
+
NOTE: The replace option is limited to a single NetApp BlueXP account. If you have multiple BlueXP accounts that you want to associate with the same SaaS Marketplace subscription, you'll need to configure them separately. 
+
NOTE: If a set of cloud credentials was never associated with a SaaS Marketplace subscription, you should configure it by following the next part of this procedure. 

. Select *Save* and *Done*. 
. Continue with Part 3 next: 
** <<Part 3a Associate the new Marketplace subscription with AWS credentials>>
** <<Part 3b Associate the new Marketplace subscription with AWS credentials for annual contracts>>.

==== Part 3a Associate the new Marketplace subscription with AWS credentials

This Part 3 of setting up a license in AWS. 

NOTE: If you have an annual contract, continue here instead: 
<<Part 3b Associate the new SaaS Marketplace subscription with AWS credentials for annual contracts>>.

.Steps

. Access the https://console.bluexp.netapp.com[NetApp BlueXP console]. 
. Validate the subscription details: 
.. From the left pane, select *Governance* > *Digital wallet*. 
.. Select the *Subscriptions* tab. 
+
image:paygo-digitalwallet-subscriptions.png[BlueXP digital wallet Subscriptions page]

.. Look for the SaaS Marketplace subscription you added during Part 1 and validate that this is the correct plan you want to use. 

. Look for the row with your AWS subscription, expand the row to see the details, and confirm that your Private offer was successfully associated with your BlueXP account. 
+
Due to limitations in AWS Marketplace, some details of the offer are not available outside of the AWS console. If one of the fields displays "N/A", it means that the information could not be retrieved from the AWS console and is not a mistake. You can still check the information in the AWS console. 
. Select the *Settings* gear at the top right side of the BlueXP console and select *Credentials*. 
+
image:paygo-digitalwallet-settings.png[BlueXP digital wallet Settings menu]

. Locate the set of credentials that you want to associate with your new SaaS Marketplace subscription. 
+
TIP: You can validate that these are correct by clicking *View*  above Working Environments. 

. Select the *Actions ...* option and select *Associate subscription*. 

. Select your Private offer in the Marketplace Subscription drop-down menu and select *Associate*. 

+
NOTE: The Marketplace charges relating to these AWS credentials will now be billed via the SaaS Marketplace subscription you just associated. If you use annual contracts, infrastructure costs associated with these AWS credentials will count as usage against your annual contract. 

. Repeat these steps for any other AWS credentials in your BlueXP account that you want to associate with this SaaS Marketplace subscription: 
.. For AWS credentials in other BlueXP accounts, use the *Account* option at the top of the BlueXP console to switch accounts and repeat the steps. 
.. For AWS credentials related to other BlueXP Connectors, use the *Connector* option at the top of the BlueXP console to switch connectors and repeat the steps. 

==== Part 3b Associate the new Marketplace subscription with AWS credentials for annual contracts

If you use an annual contract, the information in BlueXP digital wallet appears somewhat differently. 

. Access the https://console.bluexp.netapp.com[NetApp BlueXP console]. 
. Validate the subscription details: 
.. From the left pane, select *Governance* > *Digital wallet*. 
.. Select the *Subscriptions* tab. 
+
image:paygo-digitalwallet-subscriptions-annualcontract.png[BlueXP digital wallet Subscriptions page showing an annual contract]

. Look for the row with your AWS yearly contract subscription, expand the row to see the details, and confirm that your Private offer was successfully associated with your BlueXP account. 

+
image:paygo-digitalwallet-subscriptions-annualcontract-associate.png[BlueXP digital wallet Subscriptions page for an annual contract]
