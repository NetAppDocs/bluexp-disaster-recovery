Using BlueXP disaster recovery, you can replicate VMware apps on your source site to a disaster recovery remote site in the cloud using SnapMirror replication.

TIP: After you create the disaster recovery plan, identify the recurrence in the wizard, and initiate a replication to a disaster recovery site, every 30 minutes BlueXP disaster recovery verifies that the replication is actually occurring according to the plan. You can monitor the progress in the Job Monitor page.

. Select the replication plan.
. On the right, select the *Actions* option image:../use/icon-horizontal-dots.png[Actions menu icon in BlueXP disaster recovery service] and select *Replicate*.
