Before you can create a disaster recovery plan, you need to add a primary vCenter server to a site and a target vCenter disaster recovery site in BlueXP. 

After vCenters are added, BlueXP disaster recovery performs a deep discovery of the vCenter environments, including vCenter clusters, ESXi hosts, datastores, storage foot print, virtual machine details, SnapMirror replicas, and virtual machine networks.

If you added vCenters in previous releases and want to customize the discovery schedule, you must edit the vCenter server site and set the schedule. 

TIP: BlueXP disaster recovery performs discovery once every 24 hours. After setting up a site, you can later edit the vCenter to customize the discovery schedule that meets your needs. For example, if you have a large number of VMs, you can set the discovery schedule to run every 23 hours and 59 minutes. If you have a small number of VMs, you can set the discovery schedule to run every 12 hours. The minimum interval is 30 minutes and the maximum is 24 hours. 

You should first do a few manual discoveries to get the most up-to-date information about your environment. After that, you can set the schedule to run automatically.

Newly added or deleted VMs are recognized in the next scheduled discovery or during an immediate manual discovery. 

VMs can be protected only if the replication plan is in one of the following states: 

* Ready
* Failback committed
* Test failover committed


.Steps

. Log in to BlueXP and select *Protection* > *Disaster recovery* from the left nav. 
+
Youâ€™ll land on BlueXP disaster recovery Dashboard page. When you first start with the service, you need to add vCenter information. Later, the Dashboard displays data about your sites and replication plans. 
+
NOTE: Different fields appear depending on the type of site you are adding. 

. *Source*: Select *Discover vCenter servers* to enter information about the source vCenter site.  
+
TIP: If some vCenter sites already exist and you want to add more, from the top menu, select *Sites* and then select *Add*.

* Add a site, select the BlueXP Connector, and provide vCenter credentials. 


* (Applies only to on-premises sites) To accept self-signed certificates for the source vCenter, check the box. 
+
NOTE: Self-signed certificates are not as secure as other certificates. If your vCenter is *NOT* configured with certificate authority (CA) certificates, you should check this box; otherwise, the connection to the vCenter will not work.  



. Select *Add*. 
+
Next, you will add a target vCenter. 

. *Target*: 

.. Choose the target site and the location. If the target is cloud, select *AWS*.  
* (Applies only to cloud sites) *API token*: Enter the API token to authorize service access for your organization. Create the API token by providing specific organization and service roles. 
* (Applies only to cloud sites) *Long organization ID*: Enter the unique ID for the organization. You can identify this ID by clicking on the username in the Account section of the BlueXP console.

.. Select *Add*. 
+
The source and target vCenters appear on the list of sites.

== Edit the vCenter server site and customize the discovery schedule


You can edit the vCenter server site to customize the discovery schedule. For example, if you have a large number of VMs, you can set the discovery schedule to run every 23 hours and 59 minutes. If you have a small number of VMs, you can set the discovery schedule to run every 12 hours.

If you added vCenters in previous releases and want to customize the discovery schedule, you must edit the vCenter server site and set the schedule. 

If you don't want to schedule discovery, you can disable the scheduled discovery option and refresh the discovery manually at any time. 

.Steps
. From the BlueXP disaster recovery menu, select *Sites*.

. Select the site you want to edit.
. Select the Actions image:icon-vertical-dots.png[Actions icon] icon on the right and select *Edit*.
+
. In the Edit vCenter server page, edit the fields as needed.

. To customize the discovery schedule, check the *Enable scheduled discovery* box and select the date and time interval you want.

.Steps
. From the BlueXP disaster recovery menu, select *Sites*.

. Select the site you want to refresh.
. Select the Actions image:icon-vertical-dots.png[Actions icon] icon on the right and select *Refresh*.
