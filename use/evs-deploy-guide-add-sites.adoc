Before you can protect your VM infrastructure, the BlueXP disaster recovery service needs to know which VMware vCenter clusters are hosting the VMs to be protected and where those vCenters are located. The first step to providing this information to the service is to create a site to represent the source and destination datacenters. A site is a failure domain or a recovery domain. 

You need to create the following: 

* A site to represent each production datacenter where your production vCenter clusters reside
* A site for your Amazon EVS/Amazon FSxN cloud datacenter

== Create on-premises sites

Create a production vCenter site.

.Steps 

. From any page in BlueXP disaster recovery, select the *Sites* tab.

. Select “On-prem” as the Location.

. Click *Add*.

If you have other production vCenter sites, you can add them using the same steps.

== Create Amazon cloud sites

Create a DR site for Amazon EVS using Amazon FSxN storage.

. From any page in BlueXP disaster recovery, select the *Sites* tab.
