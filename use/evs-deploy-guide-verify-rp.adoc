After the plan has been added, you will be returned to the Replication plans page where you can view your replication plans and their status (Figure 4).

DRaaS will perform a series of tests to verify that all the components –- ONTAP cluster, vCenter clusters, and VMs -- are accessible and in the proper state for DRaaS to protect the VMs. This is called a compliance check, and it is run on a regular basis.

From the Replication plans screen, you will see the following information:

* Status of the last compliance check

* The replication plan’s replication state.

* The name of the protected (source) site

* The list of resource groups protected by the replication plan

* The name of the failover (destination) site.
