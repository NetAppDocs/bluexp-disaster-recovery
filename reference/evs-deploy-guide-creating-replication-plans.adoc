Now that we have vCenters to protect on the on-premises site and we have an Amazon EVS site configured to use Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP that we can use as a DR destination, we can now create a replication plan (RP) to protect any set of VMs hosted on the vCenter cluster within our on-premises site. 

To start the replication plan creation process:

. From any BlueXP disaster recovery screen, click the *Replication plans* tab.
