This BlueXP disaster recovery release includes the following updates: 

=== Failover test schedules 
* This release includes updates to the failover test schedule structure, which was needed to support daily and weekly schedules. This update requires that you disable and re-enable all existing replication plans so that you will be able to use the new daily and weekly failover test schedules. This is a one-time requirement.  
+
Here's how: 
+
. From the top menu, select *Replication plans*. 
. Select a plan and select the Actions icon to show the drop-down menu. 
. Select *Disable*. 
. After a few minutes, select *Enable*.

* *Replication plan updates*: This release includes updates to replication plan data, which resolves a "snapshot not found" issue. This requires that you change the retention count in all replication plans to 1 and initiate an on-demand snapshot. This process creates a new backup and removes all older backups.

. Note the value of the retention count in the replication plan. You will need to reinstate this original value when you're finished with these steps. 
. Reduce the count to 1.
. Initiate an on-demand snapshot. To do so, on the Replication plan page, select the plan, click the Actions icon, and select *Take snapshot now*. 
. After the snapshot job completes successfully, increase the count in the replication plan back to its original value that you noted in the first step. 
. Repeat these steps for all existing replication plans.
