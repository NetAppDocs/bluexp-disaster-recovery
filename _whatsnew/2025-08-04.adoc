This release includes the following updates: 

* Improved VMFS support to handle the same LUN presented from multiple storage virtual machines.
* Improved test teardown cleanup to handle the datastore already being unmounted and or deleted.
* Subnet mapping now validates that the gateway entered is contained within the network provided.
* Corrected an issue that could cause the replication plan to fail if the VM name contains ".com".
* Removed a restriction preventing the destination volume from being the same as the source volume when creating the volume as part of the replication plan creation.
* Added support for a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) subscription to NetApp Intelligent Services in the Azure Marketplace and added a link to the Azure Marketplace in the free trial dialog.
